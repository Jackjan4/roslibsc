# display_gfx

display_gfx is a simple graphics library for C to enable drawing primitives, curves and text on commonly used displays. It supports drawing in B/W, grayscale and color mode. It is writen to be hardware-independent and can be adapted to many displays using a hardware abstraction layer. It already provides HALs for some displays, such as: SSD1327 (OLED), SSD1306A (OLED). 
In addition, it also supports the Zephyr RTOS with integrated logging, but of course it can also be used as a stand-alone.
